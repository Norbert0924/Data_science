       "'A recent post in The Farmington Mirror — our town’s version of The Onion — encouraged parents to take advantage of a shuttle service offered by the town, which not only brings your children to schools from locations “in close proximity to your home,” but is also free!  “The decision follows complaints made on social media regarding long parent drop-off lines,” the post reads. The Mirror notes that the shuttles are “easily identifiable by their bright yellow color and traffic-stopping flashing red lights.”  It appears that the practice of driving students to and from school in privately owned cars began sometime between the 1980s (when I was in school, and there was no such thing as a “drop-off line”) and the mid-2000s, when some parents seemed aghast to learn that I actually let my children ride the school bus. Sometimes both ways!  When we moved to a house within walking distance of our neighborhood elementary school, however, I became a part of this Drop-Off Line Tribe. A number of factors often prevented us from walking to and from school, including not being ready in time to take the 13-minute walk, icy sidewalks, rain, snow, clouds, sun and children simply being unable to make their legs move.  So I’d drive them to school. Sure, we’d miss out on fresh air, exercise and nature, but my kids did witness their mom showing restraint and remaining calm in the face of adversity. This happened regularly, as some otherwise reasonable parent would scoot her minivan to the front of the line and actually put the car in park, assist her child in exiting the car, retrieve the viola from the trunk, and wipe down traces of oatmeal on her child’s face.  In any other world, those of us behind such a driver would honk our horns and gesticulate wildly, but these are our neighbors, so we’d have to pretend we didn’t mind.  I just finished reading Maria Semple’s “Where’d You Go, Bernadette,” a book in which the drop-off line features prominently, where the main character was said to have run over another parent’s foot in an effort to avoid talking to her.  At the beginning of this school year (before I caved and began letting my son drive my car) I flagrantly ignored the well-established rules in our high school parking lot. The line practically snaked across the Rhode Island border.  My son has even less patience than I, and in an effort to not be marked tardy, he bolted from the car and walked to the building. There I sat, with no child to drop off, yet still being required to spend the next 5 minutes of my life moving one car length at a time around the perimeter of the parking lot. I decided to cut through the lot, which seemed like a brilliant idea until the police officer assigned to drop-off line traffic duty told me otherwise. Oops. Sorry, sir.  My youngest child began attending a new magnet school this year, which involves both dropping him off and a bus ride, since there’s no guarantee that he’d find his way a half-mile to the bus stop in the dark. We managed to miss the bus on the first day of school so I drove him in and had the pleasure of meeting the principal and a handful of other important people waiting at the front door. As I’ve been doing for the past 16 years, I did this drive wearing slippers and something resembling pajamas, and with hair that looked like it might contain a family of birds. It’s so important to make a great first impression!  Any parent who has experienced the drop-off line has likely also experienced what is perhaps even more hellish: The pick-up line. Keep it together, friends: Follow the rules, remain calm, and maybe even let your kiddo ride the bus every now and then.  Teresa M. Pelham is a Farmington-based writer.

       "'Prosecutors filed felony charges on Wednesday against an immigrant illegally living in the U.S. who is suspected in a drunken-driving crash that killed Indianapolis Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson and an Uber driver.  Manuel Orrego-Savala, who is from Guatemala and has twice been deported from the U.S., is charged with causing death while driving intoxicated and leaving the scene of an accident. The 37-year-old said little during his initial court hearing, responding through an interpreter as the judge explained the proceedings and charges.  \"He\\'s very distraught to say the least,\" said his lawyer, Jorge Torres. \"He\\'s very confused.\"  Investigators said Orrego-Savala was driving the pickup truck that hit Jackson and his Uber driver, 54-year-old Jeffrey Monroe, while the men were standing outside Monroe\\'s car early Sunday along Interstate 70. Court documents allege a blood test conducted at a hospital determined Orrego-Savala had a blood-alcohol level of 0.19 percent, more than double Indiana\\'s legal limit for driving.  The two most serious charges each carry maximum sentence of up to 20 years in prison.  Orrego-Savala was deported in 2007 and 2009, and was again living illegally in the U.S. at the time of the crash, according to investigators. He was charged late Tuesday by federal prosecutors with illegal re-entry of a previously deported alien. He faces up to 10 years in prison on that charge, which the U.S. attorney\\'s office said would be handled after any state charges are resolved.  President Donald Trump drew added attention to the case on Twitter, calling the highway collision that killed Jackson and Monroe \"disgraceful.\" The president also prodded Democrats to work with him on illegal immigration and border security.  Marion County Prosecutor Terry Curry criticized the comments, saying his office would \"vigorously prosecute\" the fatal crash case regardless of whether Orrego-Savala was in the country illegally.  \"We are disheartened that ghoulish and inappropriate public commentary has politicized this tragedy,\" the Democratic prosecutor said in a statement. \"Much of such commentary, including tweets by the president, fails to acknowledge that both Edwin Jackson and Jeffrey Monroe lost their lives on Sunday. We will simply seek justice on behalf of the families of those two victims.\"  Torres also said that Orrego-Savala\\'s immigration status has no bearing on the crash case. The attorney noted his client has been living and doing construction work in the Indianapolis area for several years.  A spokesman for Jackson\\'s family has said his relatives are devastated and planned no response to Trump\\'s tweets about the crash and the suspect\\'s immigration status.  \"The family is in shock, as you can imagine. This obviously happened so unexpectedly,\" Atlanta attorney Daniel Meachum said.  Investigators said they believe Orrego-Savala was intoxicated at the time of the Indiana crash.  Orrego-Savala had a 2005 conviction for driving under the influence in Redwood City, California. He also has numerous other misdemeanor convictions and arrests in California and Indiana, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Nicole Alberico.  In the 2005 case, he pleaded no contest to two separate drunken-driving offenses and was given a brief jail sentence, San Mateo County District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe said Tuesday.  Orrego-Savala remains jailed in Indianapolis. Federal and county prosecutors spell his name as \"Orrego-Zavala\" in charging documents, but his attorney said his name is spelled Orrego-Savala, a spelling listed among his aliases in the federal documents.  He appeared Tuesday before a judge who advised him of his rights. Indianapolis television station WRTV reported that Orrego-Savala told the judge through an interpreter: \"I wasn\\'t driving the car. I don\\'t know why I am here.\"  A police news release did not mention the presence of anyone else in the pickup truck.'"

Manuel Orrego-Savala, who is from Guatemala and has twice been deported from the U.S., is charged with causing death while driving intoxicated and leaving the scene of an accident. The 37-year-old said little during his initial court hearing, responding through an interpreter as the judge explained the proceedings and charges.  \"He\\'s very distraught to say the least,\" said his lawyer, Jorge Torres. \"He\\'s very confused.\"  Investigators said Orrego-Savala was driving the pickup truck that hit Jackson and his Uber driver, 54-year-old Jeffrey Monroe, while the men were standing outside Monroe\\'s car early Sunday along Interstate 70. Court documents allege a blood test conducted at a hospital determined Orrego-Savala had a blood-alcohol level of 0.19 percent, more than double Indiana\\'s legal limit for driving.  The two most serious charges each carry maximum sentence of up to 20 years in prison.  Orrego-Savala was deported in 2007 and 2009, and was again living illegally in the U.S. at the time of the crash, according to investigators. He was charged late Tuesday by federal prosecutors with illegal re-entry of a previously deported alien. He faces up to 10 years in prison on that charge, which the U.S. attorney\\'s office said would be handled after any state charges are resolved.  President Donald Trump drew added attention to the case on Twitter, calling the highway collision that killed Jackson and Monroe \"disgraceful.\" The president also prodded Democrats to work with him on illegal immigration and border security.  Marion County Prosecutor Terry Curry criticized the comments, saying his office would \"vigorously prosecute\" the fatal crash case regardless of whether Orrego-Savala was in the country illegally.  \"We are disheartened that ghoulish and inappropriate public commentary has politicized this tragedy,\" the Democratic prosecutor said in a statement. \"Much of such commentary, including tweets by the president, fails to acknowledge that both Edwin Jackson and Jeffrey Monroe lost their lives on Sunday. We will simply seek justice on behalf of the families of those two victims.\"  Torres also said that Orrego-Savala\\'s immigration status has no bearing on the crash case. The attorney noted his client has been living and doing construction work in the Indianapolis area for several years.  A spokesman for Jackson\\'s family has said his relatives are devastated and planned no response to Trump\\'s tweets about the crash and the suspect\\'s immigration status.  \"The family is in shock, as you can imagine. This obviously happened so unexpectedly,\" Atlanta attorney Daniel Meachum said.  Investigators said they believe Orrego-Savala was intoxicated at the time of the Indiana crash.  Orrego-Savala had a 2005 conviction for driving under the influence in Redwood City, California. He also has numerous other misdemeanor convictions and arrests in California and Indiana, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Nicole Alberico.  In the 2005 case, he pleaded no contest to two separate drunken-driving offenses and was given a brief jail sentence, San Mateo County District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe said Tuesday.  Orrego-Savala remains jailed in Indianapolis. Federal and county prosecutors spell his name as \"Orrego-Zavala\" in charging documents, but his attorney said his name is spelled Orrego-Savala, a spelling listed among his aliases in the federal documents.  He appeared Tuesday before a judge who advised him of his rights. Indianapolis television station WRTV reported that Orrego-Savala told the judge through an interpreter: \"I wasn\\'t driving the car. I don\\'t know why I am here.\"  A police news release did not mention the presence of anyone else in the pickup truck.'"
